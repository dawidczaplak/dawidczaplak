I would like to have a chance in ML projects and Data related things. I finished one of the Python ZeroToMastery course.
In next months I'm going to touch ML related things, right now I'm introducing into scikit-learn/NumPy/pandas/seaborn/matplotlib starting with basic projects.
Also I have in my mind SQL/R and Hadoop.
